_I am a problem solver_ with a strong ability to quickly analyze complex situations. I consider myself a people person and believe that not every problem requires just engineering, but also requires a people-centric approach. I am known for my creativity, passion, motivation, strategy, and pragmatism in my work.

_I love making and breaking software_, with over 15 years of experience as a software engineer specializing in DevSecOps. My technical expertise includes Python, Golang, Linux, Kubernetes, and currently exploring Rust. I also enjoy conducting security research through binary exploitation and fuzzing, as well as bug bounty hunting for website vulnerabilities.

_In my free time_, I enjoy martial arts like Wing Chun and MMA, traveling, coffee, cubing, and reading.
