        <description>Adobe Reader progress One year ago I blogged about my many attempts and failures at fuzzing Adobe Reader and finding exploitable security issues.
Meanwhile, I realized that writing your own fuzzers is the way to go as confirmed by my first CVE-2018-19713 for Adobe Reader. Found the bug using &amp;lsquo;What The Fuzz&amp;rsquo; targeting a custom plugin I coded which integrates with Adobe Reader.
So what&amp;rsquo;s the next step?
Fuzzing FoxitReader Excellent research has been shared on exploiting FoxitReader by @steventseeley, which inspired me to switch from Adobe to Foxit as a target.</description>

        <description>Binaries vs websites It has been half a year since my last blog post covering an IDOR in a website API. About time to write about something new and hopefully interesting! Having switched my focus from websites to binaries a new world opened up to me.
The reason I switched is my passion for low-level engineering. Reading through disassemblies, walking along with code being executed in a debugger, memory corruption, etc.</description>
