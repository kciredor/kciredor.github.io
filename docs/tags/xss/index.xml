        <description>What happened Hello again and thanks for reading my second blog post! After publishing my first blog I kept on trying to hack different companies and websites. Not as easy as I had hoped for! It took me quite some time to find another security issue after the IDOR in my first month. This SOME issue I found is not to be made public, so I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to mention company details and will have to mask url&amp;rsquo;s etc.</description>
